### README for `weighted_average` Function

#### Overview

The `weighted_average` function calculates the weighted average of a dataset, with the weights provided in a separate list. This is useful in situations where different data points have different levels of importance.

#### Function Signature

```python
def weighted_average(a, b):
    # function implementation
```

#### Parameters

- `a` (list): The list of numerical values.
- `b` (list): The list of weights corresponding to each element in `a`.

#### Returns

- `float`: The weighted average of the elements in `a`.

#### Process

1. Validates that `a` and `b` have the same length.
2. Calculates the weighted sum and the sum of weights.
3. Computes the weighted average.

#### Test Suite

The provided test suite checks the function for normal cases, mismatched lengths, and zero weights.

#### Notes

- Both `a` and `b` must be of the same length.
- The sum of weights (`b`) should not be zero to avoid division by zero.

#### Example Usage

```python
values = [10, 20, 30]
weights = [1, 2, 1]
average = weighted_average(values, weights)
```

This calculates the weighted average of `values` using the corresponding `weights`.

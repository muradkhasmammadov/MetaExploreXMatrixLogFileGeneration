### README for `varianceDifference` Function

#### Overview

The `varianceDifference` function calculates the variance of the differences between corresponding elements in two samples. It's typically used in statistics to analyze the variability between two related sets of measurements.

#### Function Signature

```python
def varianceDifference(sample1, sample2):
    # function implementation
```

#### Parameters

- `sample1` (list): The first sample.
- `sample2` (list): The second sample.

#### Returns

- `float`: The variance of the differences between the elements of `sample1` and `sample2`.

#### Process

1. Validates the sample sizes.
2. Calculates the mean of the differences between corresponding elements.
3. Computes the variance based on these differences.

#### Test Suite

The test suite verifies the function's correctness, ensuring proper handling of normal cases, unequal sample sizes, and small sample sizes.

#### Notes

- Both samples should be of equal size and have more than one element.
- The function is designed to handle common scenarios in paired sample analysis.

#### Example Usage

```python
sample1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sample2 = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
variance_diff = varianceDifference(sample1, sample2)
```

This computes the variance of the differences between `sample1` and `sample2`.

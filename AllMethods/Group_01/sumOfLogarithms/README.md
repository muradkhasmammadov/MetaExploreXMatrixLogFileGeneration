### README for Sum of Logarithms Function

#### Function Description:
The `sumOfLogarithms` function calculates the sum of natural logarithms (base e) of a list of positive numerical values. It is commonly used in mathematics, statistics, and data analysis when working with data that follows exponential or logarithmic distributions.

#### Parameters:
- `elements`: A list of positive numerical elements (integers or floats).

#### Returns:
- The sum of the natural logarithms of all positive elements in the list.

#### Raises:
- `TypeError`: If the input is not a list or if the list contains non-numeric elements.
- `ValueError`: If any element in the list is not positive (zero or negative values are not allowed for logarithms).

#### Function Logic:
1. **Input Validation**: 
   - Checks if the input `elements` is a list and contains only numeric elements. If not, raises the appropriate `TypeError`.
   - Verifies that all elements in the list are positive (greater than zero). If not, raises a `ValueError` because logarithms of non-positive numbers are undefined.
2. **Logarithmic Summation**:
   - Iterates through each element in the list and calculates its natural logarithm (base e) using the `math.log` function.
   - Sums up the logarithmic values to obtain the final result.
3. **Return Sum of Logarithms**: Returns the sum of natural logarithms of the positive elements in the list.

#### Usage Example:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
result = sumOfLogarithms(numbers)
print(result)
# Output: 1.791759469228055
```

#### Note:
The `sumOfLogarithms` function is useful for scenarios where the logarithmic transformation of data is required, such as in information theory, finance, and modeling exponential growth. It assumes that the input list contains only positive values to ensure valid logarithmic calculations.

### README for Find Magnitude Function

#### Function Description:
The `find_magnitude` function calculates the magnitude (or Euclidean norm) of a vector represented as a list of numbers. This function is particularly useful in various fields such as physics, engineering, and computer science, where it is often necessary to determine the length or size of a vector in a multi-dimensional space.

#### Parameters:
- `a`: A list of numbers representing the components of a vector.

#### Returns:
- The magnitude of the vector as a float.

#### Raises:
- `TypeError`: If the input is not a list.
- `ValueError`: If the input list is empty.

#### Function Logic:
1. **Input Validation**: 
   - Checks if the input `a` is a list. If not, raises a `TypeError`.
   - Checks if the list `a` is empty. If so, raises a `ValueError`.
2. **Magnitude Calculation**:
   - Uses a list comprehension to square each element in the list.
   - Calculates the sum of these squared values.
   - Takes the square root of this sum using `math.sqrt` to find the magnitude.
3. **Return Magnitude**: Returns the calculated magnitude.

#### Usage Example:
```python
vector = [3, 4, 5]
magnitude = find_magnitude(vector)
print(magnitude)
# Output: 7.0710678118654755
```

#### Note:
The magnitude of a vector is a fundamental concept in vector mathematics and physics, often used to determine the length of a vector in Euclidean space. This function simplifies the process of calculating the magnitude, making it accessible for various applications where vector operations are necessary. It is important to note that the input list should contain numerical values, as the function computes mathematical operations on these elements.

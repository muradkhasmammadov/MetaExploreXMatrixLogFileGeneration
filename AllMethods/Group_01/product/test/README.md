# Testing `product` Function

This repository provides a suite of tests for the `product` function, which determines the product of all elements in a given list of numbers.

## Tests Explanation:

- `test_product_of_integers`: Tests the product of a list of integers.
- `test_product_with_zero`: Tests the product when one of the elements in the list is zero.
- `test_product_of_single_element`: Tests the product of a list with a single element.
- `test_product_of_floats`: Tests the product of a list of floating-point numbers.
- `test_empty_list`: Tests the function's response to an empty list.
- `test_invalid_data_string`: Tests the function's response to a list of strings.
- `test_invalid_data_mixed`: Tests the function's response to a mixed list of numbers and strings.

## Running the Tests:

You can run the tests in different ways:

1. **Using unittest from Command Line**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m unittest test_product.py
   ```

2. **Running the Script Directly**:
   ```bash
   python3 test_product.py
   ```

For a more verbose output detailing each test method and its result, add `-v` to the command:
   ```bash
   python3 -m unittest -v test_product.py
   ```

Ensure that the `product_function.py` is in the same directory as the test script.

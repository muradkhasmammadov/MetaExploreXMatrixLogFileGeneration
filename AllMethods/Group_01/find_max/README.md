### README for Find Max Function

#### Function Description:
The `find_max` function is designed to find the maximum value in a given list. It iterates through each element of the list, comparing each element with the current maximum value and updating the maximum value as needed. This function is a fundamental tool in data analysis, algorithms, and general programming tasks where determining the largest element in a collection of data is required.

#### Parameters:
- `a`: A list of elements. The elements can be of any type that supports comparison operations, typically numbers.

#### Returns:
- The maximum value found in the list.

#### Raises:
- `ValueError`: If the input list is empty.

#### Function Logic:
1. **Input Validation**: 
   - Checks if the list `a` is empty. If so, raises a `ValueError` since the maximum value cannot be determined in an empty list.
2. **Finding Maximum Value**:
   - Initializes `max_val` with the first element of the list.
   - Iterates over each element in the list.
   - Compares each element with `max_val`. If an element is greater than `max_val`, updates `max_val` with this element.
3. **Return Maximum Value**: Returns `max_val`, which holds the maximum value found in the list.

#### Usage Example:
```python
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
max_number = find_max(numbers)
print(max_number)
# Output: 9
```

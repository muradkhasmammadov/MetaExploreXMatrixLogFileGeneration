### README for Count Zeros Function

#### Function Description:
The `cnt_zeros` function is designed to count the number of zero elements in a list. It provides a straightforward way to determine the frequency of zero values in a list, which can be useful in various data analysis contexts, especially where zero may signify absence, null value, or a baseline measurement.

#### Parameters:
- `elements`: A list of elements. The function will count how many of these elements are zeros.

#### Returns:
- The count of zero elements in the list.

#### Raises:
- `TypeError`: If the input is not a list.

#### Function Logic:
1. **Input Validation**: 
   - Checks if the input `elements` is indeed a list. If not, a `TypeError` is raised.
2. **Counter Initialization**:
   - Initializes a counter `cnt` to 0. This will be used to keep track of the number of zero elements.
3. **Iterate and Count**:
   - Iterates through each element in the list.
   - If an element equals zero, increments the counter `cnt`.
4. **Return Count**: After iterating through the entire list, the function returns `cnt`, which reflects the number of zero elements found.

#### Usage Example:
```python
data = [0, 1, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0]
zero_count = cnt_zeros(data)
print(zero_count)
# Output: 4
```

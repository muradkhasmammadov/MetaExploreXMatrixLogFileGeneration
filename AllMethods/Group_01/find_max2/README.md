### README for Find Max2 Function

#### Function Description:
The `find_max2` function calculates the maximum sum of two adjacent elements in a given list. This function is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to find the largest combined value of pairs in a sequential dataset, such as in signal processing, financial analysis, or other numerical computations.

#### Parameters:
- `a`: A list of numerical elements. The list must contain at least two elements.

#### Returns:
- The maximum sum of any two adjacent elements in the list.

#### Raises:
- `ValueError`: If the list contains fewer than two elements.

#### Function Logic:
1. **Input Validation**: 
   - Checks if the list `a` contains at least two elements. If not, raises a `ValueError`.
2. **Finding Maximum Adjacent Sum**:
   - Initializes `max_sum` with the sum of the first two elements in the list.
   - Iterates over the list, starting from the second element and going up to the second-to-last element.
   - For each element, calculates the sum of this element and the next element (`current_sum`).
   - Compares `current_sum` with `max_sum`. If `current_sum` is greater, updates `max_sum` with this value.
3. **Return Maximum Adjacent Sum**: Returns `max_sum`, which holds the maximum sum of any two adjacent elements found in the list.

#### Usage Example:
```python
numbers = [10, 20, 3, 30, 50, 11]
max_adjacent_sum = find_max2(numbers)
print(max_adjacent_sum)
# Output: 80 (sum of 30 and 50)
```

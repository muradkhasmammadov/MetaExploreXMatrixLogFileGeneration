#### Overview

The `lag1_autocorrelation` function is a Python function designed to calculate a variant of autocorrelation for a given set of numerical elements and their mean. Autocorrelation measures the correlation of a signal with a delayed copy of itself at various time intervals (lags). This function specifically calculates the measure with a lag of 1.

#### Function Signature

```python
def lag1_autocorrelation(elements, mean):
    # function implementation
```

#### Parameters

- `elements` (list): A list of numerical values representing the time series data.
- `mean` (float): The mean (average) of the `elements`.

#### Returns

- `float`: The calculated autocorrelation value for the given data.

#### Process

1. Initialize variables for accumulation (`v` and `q`).
2. Iterate over each element in the `elements`.
3. Calculate the deviation from the mean for the current and previous elements.
4. Update `q` and `v` with new calculated values.
5. Return the ratio of `q` to `v`, handling the case where `v` is zero.

#### Test Suite

A small test suite is provided to ensure the function works as expected. It covers basic cases, including a constant series and a simple numeric series.

#### Notes

- The function assumes that `elements` is a list of numerical values and that `mean` is pre-calculated.
- It handles edge cases, like an empty list or a constant series, to avoid division by zero errors.

#### Example Usage

```python
data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
mean_data = sum(data) / len(data)
autocorrelation_result = lag1_autocorrelation(data, mean_data)
```

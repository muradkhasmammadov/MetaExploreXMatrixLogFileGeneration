### README for `shell_sort` Function

#### Overview

The `shell_sort` function implements the Shell sort algorithm, an in-place comparison sort. It is a generalization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart. The function takes an array and sorts it in ascending order.

#### Function Signature

```python
def shell_sort(arr):
    # function implementation
```

#### Parameters

- `arr` (list): The list of numerical values to be sorted.

#### Returns

- `list`: The sorted list.

#### Process

1. Initializes a `gap` variable, starting at half the length of the array.
2. Performs a gap-based insertion sort.
3. Gradually reduces the gap and repeats the process until the gap is 0.
4. Returns the sorted array.

#### Test Suite

A test suite is provided to verify the sorting correctness for various cases, including regular lists, empty lists, and single-element lists.

#### Notes

- The Shell sort algorithm is more efficient than a simple insertion sort, particularly for larger arrays.
- This function modifies the input array in place.

#### Example Usage

```python
sorted_array = shell_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])
```

This example demonstrates sorting an array using the Shell sort algorithm.

### README for Reverse Function

#### Function Description:
`reverse` is a Python function designed to reverse the order of elements in a list. The function creates a new list and appends elements from the original list in reverse order, starting from the last element to the first.

#### Parameters:
- `a`: The list whose elements are to be reversed.

#### Returns:
- A new list containing the elements of the original list in reverse order.

#### Raises:
- `TypeError`: If the input is not a list.

#### Function Logic:
1. **Input Validation**: The function checks if the input `a` is a list. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.
2. **Reversal Process**:
   - The function initializes an empty list `r`.
   - It then iterates over the elements of `a` in reverse order, starting from the last element.
   - Each element is appended to the list `r`.
3. **Return Reversed List**: After iterating through all elements, the function returns the list `r`, which contains the elements of `a` in reverse order.

#### Usage Example:
```python
original_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reversed_list = reverse(original_list)
print(reversed_list)
# Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

#### Note:
This function creates and returns a new list with the elements reversed, leaving the original list unchanged. It's a straightforward implementation suitable for reversing elements in any list, regardless of the type of elements it contains.

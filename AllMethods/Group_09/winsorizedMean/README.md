#### Function Description:
`winsorizedMean` is a function designed to calculate the mean of a sorted list after applying Winsorization, a statistical technique used to limit the influence of extreme values in a dataset.

#### Parameters:
- `sortedElements`: A sorted list of numerical elements.
- `left`: The number of elements from the left (smallest values) end of the list to be replaced.
- `right`: The number of elements from the right (largest values) end of the list to be replaced.

#### Returns:
- The Winsorized mean of the list.

#### Test Suite:
The provided test suite verifies the function's correctness in various scenarios: a normal case with Winsorization, handling of an empty list, extreme Winsorization (where the majority of elements are replaced), and a case with no Winsorization.

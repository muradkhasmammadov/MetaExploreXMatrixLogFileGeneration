### README for `sumOfPowerOfDeviations` Function

#### Overview

The `sumOfPowerOfDeviations` function is a Python function designed to calculate the sum of the k-th power of deviations of elements in a dataset from a constant. It's useful in various statistical computations.

#### Function Signature

```python
def sumOfPowerOfDeviations(data, k, c):
    # function implementation
```

#### Parameters

- `data` (list): A list of numerical values.
- `k` (int): The power to which each deviation is raised.
- `c` (float): The constant from which deviations are calculated.

#### Returns

- `float`: The sum of the k-th power of deviations of each element in `data` from `c`.

#### Process

1. Iterates through each element in `data`.
2. Calculates the k-th power of the deviation of each element from `c`.
3. Sums up these powers and returns the result.

#### Test Suite

A test suite is provided to ensure the function's correctness under various scenarios, including normal cases, empty data, and single-element data.

#### Notes

- The function handles empty lists and returns 0 in such cases.
- It's designed to be straightforward and efficient for typical use cases in statistical analysis.

#### Example Usage

```python
data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
k = 2
c = 25
sum_dev = sumOfPowerOfDeviations(data, k, c)
```

This calculates the sum of the squared deviations of each element in `data` from 25.
